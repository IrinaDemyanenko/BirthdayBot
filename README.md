# @BirthdayBot is a Telegramm-bot, that will help you to be
thoughtful to your relatives and friends.

This bot gives you the opportunity to create a personalised
list of friends with their birthdays. When someone on your
list has a birthday, the bot will remind you about it by sending
a notification to your personal chat room.

### How does it works?
* 1.Open Telegramm and find @RemindeBirthdayBot (https://t.me/RemindeBirthdayBot).

* 2.Click /start to authorise.

* 3.Then 'Зарегистрироваться'.

Authorization is very important part!
Authorisation assigns you a unique number in the database, so that
all the names and friends you choose to keep will be saved exactly
to your list with your personal number.

* 4.Use /add every time you want to add someone to your list.

* 5.Use /remind_me to select a suitable time to receive
notifications about a friend's birthday; this command activates the notification
function, starts with a delayed start time of 1 minute.
Notifications will come at the same time every day (if you run
the command /remind_me at 10.00, notifications will come daily at 10.00;
to adjust the time - run the function at a convenient time of the day).

* 6.Use /check if you want to check the availability of birthday boys
right now without waiting for notifications. The command starts a
forced check of records in the database.

* 7.Use /help to see @BirthdayBot capabilities.
